# fake-http-auth-generator
This is a simple HTTP POST generator which creates a number of 'semi-random' requests to domain list specified as a argument. 
Useful to create some noise on the wire if you want people to spot your fake authentication requests. Included is the list of top 10000 domains.

python fake-http.py <path to domain list>
